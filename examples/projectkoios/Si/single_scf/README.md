# Silicon single-SCF examples

This hierarchy keeps calculator projections and comparison as three separate examples:

- [`vasp/`](vasp/README.md): deterministic VASP projection and retained-output replay;
- [`qe/`](qe/README.md): deterministic Quantum ESPRESSO projection and retained-output replay;
- [`comparator/`](comparator/README.md): qualified comparison of the two retained common results.

The shared example-only `workflow/dft_pw_scf/` directory owns the optional local SNAKES child-workflow implementation. `workflow/runner/` owns common projection, replay, planning, and comparison commands. Calculator directories contain declarations, not workflow nets or duplicated runners.

Convergence examples are separately organized under [`convergence/`](convergence/README.md).

`common/structures/` is the explicit temporary structure-repository boundary. It must be revisited when an owned durable structure database contract exists.
